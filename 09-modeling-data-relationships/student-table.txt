1. Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data types should be used, etc.,
and include them in a text file.

  I believe that for a proper student record keeping database, we would need multiple tables. A student table containing
  an integer ID, first_name, and last_name. A student_records table containing student ID, class code (ex: PSY 101), professor_name
  and the letter grade. A possible creation of these tables:

  CREATE TABLE students (
	id int,
  	first_name VARCHAR(20),
  	last_name VARCHAR(20)
    );

  CREATE TABLE student_records (
    id int,
  	student_id int,
    class_code VARCHAR(7)
    professor_name VARCHAR(20),
    grade VARCHAR(1)
  );


2. Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts
sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Submit queries for the following data and include
the results:

    All students who have taken a particular class.

      SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, student_records.class_code FROM students AS s
      JOIN student_records ON s.id = student_records.student_id WHERE student_records.class_code = 'CS 101';

      OUTPUT:

      first_name	last_name	 class_code
      John	      Smith	     CS 101
      Jane	      Doe	       CS 101
      Joe	        Schmoe	   CS 101
      Tonya	      Tester	   CS 101
      Daniel	    Database	 CS 101


    The number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.

      SELECT student_records.class_code, student_records.grade, COUNT (student_records.grade) from student_records
      GROUP BY student_records.grade, student_records.class_code HAVING student_records.class_code = 'CS 101';

      OUTPUT:

      class_code	grade	count
      CS 101	    A	     2
      CS 101	    B	     1
      CS 101	    C	     1
      CS 101	    F	     1


    Class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.

      SELECT student_records.class_code, COUNT (student_records.class_code) AS student_registration
      FROM student_records GROUP BY student_records.class_code;

      OUTPUT:

      class_code	student_registration
      EE 301	     2
      PSY 101	     2
      CS 101	     5
      PHY 201	     3

    The class taken by the largest number of students.

      SELECT student_records.class_code, COUNT (student_records.class_code) AS student_registration
      FROM student_records GROUP BY student_records.class_code ORDER BY student_registration DESC LIMIT 1;

      OUTPUT:

      class_code	student_registration
      CS 101	     5
